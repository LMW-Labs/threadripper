Google Cloud Twitter Analysis & Posting System: Design & Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Initial Setup & Environment Preparation

Enable Google Cloud APIs :
Cloud Run API
Cloud Pub/Sub API
Cloud Scheduler API
Vertex AI API
Secret Manager API
Cloud Storage API
(This ensures your project has access to all necessary services.)
Phase 2: Core Architecture Design (Current State)

Define Core Components :
Monitoring Service (Cloud Run) : Scans Twitter, applies "viral potential" logic.
Tweet Events Topic (Pub/Sub) : Decouples monitoring from analysis.
Analysis Service (Cloud Run) : Subscribes to tweet events, performs Gemini analysis, generates draft posts.
Gemini API Access (Vertex AI) : Provides the AI capabilities for subtext analysis.
Gemini API Key (Secret Manager) : Securely stores the API key for Vertex AI.
Review Bucket (Cloud Storage) : Stores draft posts and associated data for human review.
Review Ready Topic (Pub/Sub) : Notifies the review service that content is ready.
Review Service (Cloud Run) : Subscribes to review-ready events, presents content for human approval.
Establish Connections :
Monitoring Service publishes to Tweet Events Topic.
Tweet Events Topic triggers Analysis Service.
Analysis Service connects to Vertex AI (Gemini) and Secret Manager.
Analysis Service writes draft content to Review Bucket.
Analysis Service publishes to Review Ready Topic.
Review Ready Topic triggers Review Service.
(The final posting action, after human approval, would be triggered by the Review Service, connecting to your autoreplier.js logic.)
Phase 3: Development & Deployment (Next Steps)

Containerize Your Code : Package your src/monitors/Twitter stream.js (for Monitoring Service), src/analysis logic (for Analysis Service), and src/bot/autoreplier.js (for the final posting step, triggered by Review Service) into Docker containers.
Deploy Cloud Run Services : Deploy each container as a separate Cloud Run service (Monitoring, Analysis, Review).
Configure Pub/Sub Subscriptions : Set up push or pull subscriptions for the Analysis and Review services to receive messages from their respective Pub/Sub topics.
Configure Cloud Scheduler : Create a Cloud Scheduler job to periodically invoke your Monitoring Cloud Run service.
Secure Secrets : Ensure your src/config/secrets.js is adapted to retrieve the Gemini API key from Secret Manager at runtime.
Implement Human Review Interface : Develop or integrate an interface for your Review Service to allow human reviewers to approve or reject content.
Implement Final Posting Logic : Ensure the Review Service, upon approval, triggers the autoreplier.js logic to post the comment.
